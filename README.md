# Urban Water Security Measures Literature Survey

### Overview
This repository contains an Excel file titled Research_ data.xlsx. This file includes a comprehensive survey of literature on urban water security measures, carried out in May 2022. 
The dataset has been compiled to support the results presented in the thesis: "Urban water security assessment: a downscaled approach" by Juliana Marcal, submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Bath. It can be used to support researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in understanding the current state of knowledge, key themes, and measures employed in the field of urban water security.
